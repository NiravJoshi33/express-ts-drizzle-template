# Express App Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of a robust, efficient, and secure Express app template built with TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, and SQLite. The app follows best practices and industry standards to ensure maintainability, scalability, and security.

## Technology Stack

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment
- Express: Web application framework
- TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript
- Drizzle ORM: Lightweight and efficient ORM for SQLite
- SQLite: Lightweight and embedded relational database
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Authentication mechanism
- bcrypt: Password hashing library

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main source code of the application
  - `controllers/`: Contains the route handlers and business logic
  - `middleware/`: Contains custom middleware functions
  - `models/`: Contains the database models and schemas
  - `routes/`: Contains the route definitions
  - `services/`: Contains reusable services and utilities
  - `app.ts`: Main entry point of the application
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests and integration tests
- `config/`: Contains configuration files for different environments
- `docs/`: Contains documentation files
- `node_modules/`: Contains installed dependencies (generated by npm)

## Application Flow

1. The Express app is initialized in `app.ts`, where middleware and routes are configured.
2. Incoming requests are handled by the defined routes in the `routes/` directory.
3. Route handlers in the `controllers/` directory process the requests, interact with the database using models, and send responses.
4. Middleware functions in the `middleware/` directory are used for tasks such as authentication, error handling, and request validation.
5. Services in the `services/` directory encapsulate reusable business logic and utilities.
6. The database models in the `models/` directory define the structure and relationships of the data stored in SQLite.

## Security Measures

- Helmet: Adds security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- CORS: Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to restrict access from unauthorized domains.
- Rate Limiting: Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect against DDoS attacks.
- JWT Authentication: Uses JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication and authorization.
- Password Hashing: Stores hashed passwords using bcrypt to protect against password breaches.
- Input Validation: Validates and sanitizes user input to prevent injection attacks.
- Error Handling: Implements centralized error handling to prevent sensitive information leakage.

## Database

- SQLite is used as the embedded database for simplicity and ease of setup.
- Drizzle ORM is used to interact with the database, providing a type-safe and efficient way to query and manipulate data.
- Database migrations are used to manage schema changes and maintain database integrity.

## Testing

- Unit tests are written for individual components, such as controllers, services, and middleware.
- Integration tests are written to test the interaction between components and ensure the overall functionality of the application.
- Test coverage is measured and maintained at a high level to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Logging and Monitoring

- Logging is implemented using a logging library (e.g., Winston) to capture important events and errors.
- Logs are stored in a centralized location for easy access and analysis.
- Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) are used to track application performance, resource usage, and error rates.

## Deployment

- The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are set up to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- The application is deployed to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for high availability and scalability.

## Scalability

- The application is designed to be stateless, allowing for horizontal scaling by adding more instances behind a load balancer.
- Caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) are used to improve performance and reduce database load.
- Asynchronous processing is utilized for resource-intensive tasks to prevent blocking the main event loop.

## Maintenance and Updates

- Regular security updates and patches are applied to dependencies and the underlying infrastructure.
- Code reviews and pull requests are enforced to maintain code quality and catch potential issues early.
- Automated tests are run on each code change to ensure the stability and integrity of the application.
- Documentation is kept up to date with any changes or additions to the codebase.

## Conclusion

This architecture document provides an overview of the Express app template, highlighting the key components, best practices, and industry standards followed. By adhering to this architecture, the application aims to be robust, efficient, secure, and maintainable.
